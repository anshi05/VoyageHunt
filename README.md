# VoyageHunt - A Gamified Tourism App

**Problem Statement:** Tourism often lacks engaging and interactive experiences, resulting in missed opportunities for travelers to discover unique local attractions and fully immerse themselves in the local culture

**Solution:** Design a sophisticated **gamified tourism app** that encourages users to deeply explore their destination by earning points for uncovering hidden attractions and completing challenges and quests. These could include tasks like uploading photos taken from specific angles to match reference images. The app should also feature leaderboards, rewards, and integrated social sharing, enhancing the overall experience and fostering a sense of competition and achievement.
