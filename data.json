    "info_history": "The Malpe Beach is a virgin beach, located at a distance about 6 kms from Udupi. It is an important port and a fishing harbor in the state of Karnataka. The endless stretch of golden sand, graciously swaying palm trees, clear blue sky and the gentle murmur of the sea, set the perfect mood for an idyllic holiday. Be sure to visit the Balarama Temple and Malpeâ€™s oldest tile factory, set up by the Basel Mission.",
